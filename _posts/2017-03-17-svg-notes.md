Notation images created with verovio from Humdrum data now
embed pitch and rhythm information directly into the SVG files.
This information can be used to control styling of the notation, such as
coloring pitches/pitch-classes with CSS, or doing basic pitch/duration
analyses of the music directly from the image.

See the [myVHV page on SVG notes](/myvhv/svg_notes) for a description
of the data encoding, and example uses such as an implementation of
[online key finding](/myvhv/svg_notes/#key-analysis-directly-from-svg-images)
from note data extracted from an SVG image.
